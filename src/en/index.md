    <h3>The context</h3>
    <p>
    The three of us successfully applied for the next funding round of the <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/">Prototype Fund</a> in the Civic Tech category with the "Citizen Knowledge Graph" project. The funding phase will last 6 months from March 2024. We will share one full-time position between us.</p>
    
    <h3>The team</h3>
    <p>All three of us are <a href="https://digitalservice.bund.de/en/fellowships/tech4germany">Tech4Germany</a> alumni. <a href="https://github.com/benjaminaaron">Benjamin</a> is currently working as a software developer in the "Neues Rechtsinformationssystem‚Äù project at DigitalService. <a href="https://espinosaureta.com/">Vanessa</a> improves digital administrative services at ifok. And <a href="https://github.com/wbglaeser">Ben</a> develops machine learning models at SoundCloud as a data engineer. Contact: <a href="mailto:citizenknowledgegraph@googlegroups.com">citizenknowledgegraph@googlegroups.com</a></p>
    
    <h3>The idea</h3>
    <p>It's about providing citizens with a safe and private place for data points, the sovereignty of which is completely in their hands. This inventory continues to grow with each use and can be used to automatically fill out forms. In addition, the app acts like an agent that is constantly looking for new opportunities for citizens without ever revealing any data. This works by downloading queries that run on your own data and, for example, check eligibility for specific funding. Results remain local. Appropriate information comes to you instead of having to search for it. The third aspect is to provide support with planning: for example, to compare different scenarios of joint parental leave planning.</p>
    
    <h3>The search for data and partners</h3>
    <p>We are currently looking for data sources that we can use for a first prototype of the idea - the more structured this data is, the better. We want to provide real citizens with real added value by making them aware of offers from the state or their municipalities to which they are entitled but which they may not yet know about. These can be concrete support measures such as child allowances, but also further training, opportunities for social engagement and much more. We would also be very happy if anyone is interested in bringing in their own "data area" to discuss together how we might create added value with it.</p>
